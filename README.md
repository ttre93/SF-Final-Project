# SF-Final-Project
Final project of the SF Data Analyst / Data Scientist course. 

Goal: 
To create a machine learning model which predicts, which cars on the market are worth buying, and which are most like a "bad buy" - they are faulty, and cant be sold with profit.

Data: 
Huge dataset from a US car dealer with 65000 sold cars and 33 columns with info about the cars like car price, model, wheel type, color etc.

What did I do?
- exploratory data analysis
- data cleaning
- feature engineering
- feature selection
- I trained six machine learning models and measured their performance
- I created a complete pipeline and summarized whole process into a single function, which can be used on the "aim" data, for which the prediction should be carried out.

I also had to deal with was a limited computing time of each code cell, and limited memory, therefore optimization of whole process was necessary.
